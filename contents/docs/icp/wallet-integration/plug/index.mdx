Welcome to the Plug Wallet Integration guide. Here, you'll find all the information you need to get started.

## Overview

Plug Wallet is a browser extension wallet that allows users to interact with the Internet Computer blockchain. It enables users to interact with dapps, manage their ICP tokens, and engage with the ecosystem's offerings.


## Getting Started

### Installation

To integrate Plug Wallet in your ICP project, follow these steps:

1. Install the Plug Wallet extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plug/cfbfdhimifdmdehjmkdobpcjfefblkjm) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/plug/) or [Brave Extenions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plug/cfbfdhimifdmdehjmkdobpcjfefblkjm).
2. Create a new account or import an existing account.

### Setup

Once you have installed the **Plug Wallet** extension, you can start using it in your ICP project.
1. Follow along the [offical guide](https://docs.plugwallet.ooo/getting-started/connect-to-plug/) to integrate Plug Wallet in your project or if you are using any packages such as `ic-auth` follow their documentation to set up.
2. Open your **Plug Extension** and  click on Settings.
3. Go to Developer Zone and enable **Test Mode**.
4. Go to Network and Create a New Network with the following details:
   - Name: `Any name of your choice`
   - Host URL : `127.0.0.1:4943`
5. Click on **Create New Network**.

You're good to go ðŸš€

## Common Issues

1. **Error in connecting**: Error: Gateway returned an error: Code: 400 () Body: subnet_not_found

   **Solution** : This error occurs when the DEV Mode is turned off and Network is not set.
   - Open your **Plug Extension** and  click on Settings.
   - Go to Developer Zone and enable **Test Mode**.
   - Go to Network and Create a New Network with the following details:
     - Name: `Any name of your choice`
     - Host URL : `127.0.0.1:4943`
   - Click on **Create New Network**.

   This should fix the issue. Try refreshing the page and closing the extension to make sure the updates are reflected.

   <Note title="Note " type="warning">
   This issue will persist if you are using `ic-auth` package, since the host is not configured to use local network in the package.
