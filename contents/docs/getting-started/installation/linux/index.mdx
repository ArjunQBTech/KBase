## Overview

Welcome to the Linux guide. This document will guide you through the steps to install ICP on a Linux OS.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- A Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora).
- A 64-bit machine (System type x64 based PC).

## Installation Steps

1. **Update Your System:**
   Open your terminal and run the following commands to update your system packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```
2. **Installing Curl:**
   Curl is required for downloading the installation scripts. Install it using the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install curl
   ```
3. **Installing NVM:**
   Run the following command to install NVM:
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
   ```

   Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
   ```

   Open a new terminal session or run the following command to apply the changes:
   source ~/.bashrc

   Verify the installation by checking the NVM version:
   ```bash
   nvm --version
   ```
4. **Installing Node:**
   Use NVM to install the latest version of Node.js:
   ```bash
   nvm install node
   ```
5. **Installing DFX (ICP SDK):**
   Run the following command to install DFX:
   ```bash
   sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"```
